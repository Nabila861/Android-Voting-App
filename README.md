# Android-Voting-App
This is a Voting App made using Android Studio using Java as the language of preference. It is a fully finished app which allows admin(s) to start the voting process and students to vote for their potential candidate. The results are displayed in an interactive dashboard.

This application is an Android application specifically designed to streamline and enhance the 
process of electing faculty candidates in Xiamen University Malaysia. The system encompasses three main user types: 
administrative personnel (admins), students and candidates. Admin(s) and students can both login 
and register but candidates will only be able to register for their chance to get voted. This project's 
primary objective was to create a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly digital solution that 
simplifies the conventional voting process that is required when choosing representatives for a 
specific educational faculty, thereby saving time and resources.
